# Intro to tensorflow

This was part of Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Course with Udacity.

Here I create a simple single layer neural network in Tensorflow. I implement data normalisation and then build and train the network with Tensorflow.

## Running the code
A Conda environment file is provided to easily install all the necessary packages. You need jupyter notebook to open and run the code.
